# OSCP-Like-Labs-

This repository documents my systematic approach to solving OSCP-aligned penetration testing labs across multiple platforms, including Hack The Box, TryHackMe, VulnHub, PortSwigger, and Proving Grounds.

The objective of this repository is to strengthen practical offensive security skills through structured lab analysis that mirrors real-world engagement workflows.

Each machine walkthrough includes:

Comprehensive reconnaissance and enumeration methodology

Service and vulnerability analysis

Exploitation techniques with technical explanation

Privilege escalation methodology (Linux/Windows)

Post-exploitation observations

Tools utilized and reasoning behind their selection

Key technical takeaways and concepts

All documentation reflects a methodology-driven approach focused on understanding attack paths rather than simply obtaining flags.

This repository serves as a structured knowledge base for OSCP preparation and continuous improvement in penetration testing.
